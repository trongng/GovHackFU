","<p>FedUni's Geology program is wide-ranging, whilst allowing
students to specialise in Exploration/mine geology or Environmental
Geology. It is structured around a mixture of lectures, field
excursions and laboratory practicals, with the aim of providing a
fundamental understanding of the science of geology and practical
career skills.<br>

<br>

 In addition to the fundamentals of geology, emphasis is placed on
communication skills, computer literacy, data analysis, and a
strong applied component involving frontier range experiences. You
will learn about the processes that allow us to extract natural
resources while ensuring a safe, natural balance is retained.</p>
<p>The Geology program provides expert education for students who
wish to pursue professional careers in mineral and oil exploration,
extractive industries, environmental science and hydrology, and
other areas associated with the Earth Sciences. The prime focus is
upon the acquisition of the practical skills of rock and mineral
identification and description and the acquisition of geological
data in the field.</p>
<p>The program aims to produce graduates who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sound understanding of the functioning of the lithosphere,
hydrosphere, and atmosphere;</li>
<li>a good working knowledge of rocks, minerals, and fossils -
their characteristics and importance in Geology and to the
functioning of a modern civilisation;</li>
<li>a sound understanding of the formation of the earth, its
tectonics, chemistry and physics and its evolution to its present
situation;</li>
<li>a good grounding in environmental aspects and/or mining
geology, coupled with the ability to link these facets with their
training in the earth sciences; and</li>
<li>the ability to plan and manage earth resources and understand a
range of issues and problems relating to man's exploitation of such
resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Not accepting applications for 2016. This program is being
replaced by Bachelor of Geoscience which will commence in 2016

","<p>With our degree, you'll learn all about the structure, physical
history, substance and dynamic systems of our planet. You'll use
mapping, technology and historical data to build conceptual models,
and learn how these models can help you predict earthquakes, reduce
natural hazards and estimate where mineral, water and carbon sit
below ground level. And we'll teach you how to extract these
resources in a sustainable way.<br>
<br>
 This degree is highly interactive and teaches you the specialised
skills you need to work in this field. During your degree, you can
choose to specialise in exploration/mine geoscience or
environmental geoscience.<br>
<br>
 You'll learn in lectures, our labs and during field trips and once
you graduate, you can work with a wide range of companies,
government bodies and as a self-employed consultant.<br>
<br>
 You may join other graduates from FedUni working in the mineral
and energy resources sectors, government geoscience organisations,
engineering and water resources industry or at environmental
consultancies.</p>
<p>The program is structured around a mixture of lectures, field
excursions and laboratory practicals, with the aim of providing a
fundamental understanding of the science of geology and practical
career skills.</p>
<p><br>
 In addition to the fundamentals of geology, emphasis is placed on
communication skills, computer literacy, data analysis, and a
strong applied component involving frontier range experiences. You
will learn about the processes that allow us to extract natural
resources while ensuring a safe, natural balance is retained.</p>
<p>The program provides expert education for students who wish to
pursue professional careers in mineral and oil exploration,
extractive industries, environmental science and hydrology, and
other areas associated with the Earth Sciences. The prime focus is
upon the acquisition of the practical skills of rock and mineral
identification and description and the acquisition of geological
data in the field.</p>
<p>The program aims to produce graduates who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sound understanding of the functioning of the lithosphere,
hydrosphere, and atmosphere;</li>
<li>a good working knowledge of rocks, minerals, and fossils -
their characteristics and importance in Geology and to the
functioning of a modern civilisation;</li>
<li>a sound understanding of the formation of the earth, its
tectonics, chemistry and physics and its evolution to its present
situation;</li>
<li>a good grounding in environmental aspects and/or mining
geology, coupled with the ability to link these facets with their
training in the earth sciences; and</li>
<li>the ability to plan and manage earth resources and understand a
range of issues and problems relating to man's exploitation of such
resources.</li>

with children. You want to be a mentor, leader and teacher. With
our double degree, you'll spend a quarter of your classes
practicing the sporting skills you can go on to teach along with
recreational skills like navigation, rock climbing and alpine
travel. Once you graduate, you may choose to teach health, PE or
outdoor education at a secondary school. Or perhaps you'll manage
an adventure tourism business or work with councils to improve the
health of their communities.<br>

You'll study subjects like global health, sport coaching and land
management and use our new multimillion dollar Sports and

activity with hands-on experiences including excursions, camps,
fieldwork and more. And we'll teach you <em>how</em> to teach
whilst you put these skills to practice in school settings each
year.<br>

outdoor educator through options for how you want to study. You can
choose from full-time or part-time options, and can learn through
face-face as well and online components.This program aims to
develop graduates with the knowledge, skills and dispositions
necessary for a highly effective career in the dynamic outdoor
education and/or teaching professions. The program aims to develop

relationships. In health and physical education there is a strong
orientation towards developing vocationally relevant knowledge and
skills, through learning opportunities that blend theoretical
knowledge with practice.</p>

","<p>You love the outdoors and want to share this passion with other
people. You want to lead, inspire and teach others. You want a
degree that'll see you exploring alpine areas, rock-climbing and
bushwalking. And when you graduate, you want options to work in
different areas across your career. During this degree, you'll
learn leadership, teaching and people skills and put these into
practice in classroom settings.</p>
<p>Your subjects are hands-on and include parks management, bush
environments, and aquatic safety. Your studies will focus on
practical physical activity with hands-on experiences including
excursions, camps, fieldwork and more. Your future may see you
teaching in Australia or overseas, leading students on major school
trips, or running outdoor education centres. Perhaps you'll work in
resorts, councils or community organisations. And maybe you'll
start your own ecotourism company.</p>
<p>The program combines the study of outdoor and environmental
education knowledge, skills and values with the development of
competence and experience in outdoor activities. Outdoor activities
are viewed as approaches to gaining access to more natural settings
and as a medium for developing human/nature relationships.<br>

<br>

 The theoretical perspective of the program aims to develop
students' understanding of the interdependence of culture and the
natural environment. It also helps in identifying the influence of
cultural beliefs on environmental and outdoor education issues and
practices through critical, strategic and reflective thinking.</p>","<p>For further program information contact:</p>

","<p>You have an interest in figures. In how companies operate. How
to make businesses profitable. And how to market these businesses
to the right audience. But you're also a keen sportsperson, whether
a participant or a supporter. This double degree can lead to you
marketing major sporting teams, managing the finances for
multi-million dollar sporting facilities and advising councils on
their recreational facilities.<br>

<br>

 The mix of sports industry skills and business expertise doubles
your job options when you graduate and you can even take your
business skills to different industries altogether.<br>

<br>

 This double degree is designed to provide you with theoretical and
practical knowledge about the sport industry, combined with an
extensive grounding in business expertise. It will provide you with
an understanding of the broad principles associated with sport and
recreation, as well as the management of organisations, personnel
and facilities.<br>

<br>

 Your subjects range from legal studies to health promotion, human
movement to media. And you'll get practical experience through a
final semester full-time internship placement in the sporting
industry. This is a chance to learn from the experts and make
contacts which are likely to obtain your future work.<br>

","<p>If you are passionate about animal science, this program
provides an exciting opportunity to focus on animal health and
ecology.</p>
<p>You will study a wide range of topics including anatomy, animal
health, biochemistry, cellular metabolism, immunology,
microbiology, physiology and zoology. The program offers a regional
perspective relevant to local wildlife and animal health, and will
also highlight key issues of international relevance by exploring
suitable examples and case studies. Laboratory-bases learning is
supported by fieldwork at sites such as farming and breeding
enterprises, animal health practices and natural habitiats with
wildlife populations. In the final year, an applied research
project enables students to undertake meaningful research and
develop technical skills.</p>
<p>You'll graduate ready for work in areas like animal welfare,
animal quarantine, wild animal management and the animal
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.<br>

","<p>You're a creative at heart and you want to build a career doing
what you love.<br>

<br>

With this degree, you'll developed the skills and knowledge needed
to become a professional artist, whether it's in drawing, digital
art or 2D practices. You'll learn in our modern studios and bounce
ideas off your teachers and fellow students. You'll learn about the
history and theory of art and design and how to get the most out of
your career as an artist.</p>
<p>Your first year is all about learning different techniques,
while in your second year you'll go more in-depth by working on
projects. Then, in your third year, you'll prepare your own
self-directed project using research and your favourite arts
practice.</p>
<p>This program integrates studies in a range of specialist studio
disciplines and Art Theory, and is offered at our Camp Street and
SMB campuses (Ballarat), our Gippsland Centre for Art and Design
(Churchill) and at Western Sydney Institute (Nepean College,
domestic students only).<br>

<br>

 During the first year of the academic program students are
introduced to a range of activities focussed on providing a breadth
of experience and skills building. The first year is structured so
that a student will undertake courses in both two-dimensional and
Multi Dimensional studios, as well as Drawing, Digital Art and the
History and Theory of Art and Design. In this academic program the
learning may take place in a studio or workshop, lecture, tutorial,
library, gallery or any other learning setting, on or off
campus.<br>

<br>

 The structure of the second year of the program involves further
in-depth studies undertaken in Drawing, Digital Art and the History
and Theory of Art and Design. In the Studio Art Practice courses,
students will gain further experience in a range of media although
with an increased emphasis on self-initiating projects,
particularly in semester four.<br>

<br>

 In the third year of the program, students will be required to
propose a self-directed project incorporating research and
contemporary art practice. This project will be supported by staff
from a number of specialist studios. Students will be able to work
in, or across, the different studios as their individual projects
demand. Additionally, in third year students also undertake a
course in Professional Art Practice.<br>

<br>

 We provide open, flexible studios, designed to facilitate
contemporary art practice supported by preparation and material
workshops. All teaching staff are practicing artists and designers
with considerable reputation in Australia.</p>","<p>Tel: 5327 8000<br>
